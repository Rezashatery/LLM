## What is an LLM?
An LLM is a neural network designed to understand, generate, and respond to human-
like text. These models are deep neural networks trained on massive amounts of text
data, sometimes encompassing large portions of the entire publicly available text on
the internet.
The “large” in “large language model” refers to both the model’s size in terms of
parameters and the immense dataset on which it’s trained. Models like this often have
tens or even hundreds of billions of parameters, which are the adjustable weights in
the network that are optimized during training to predict the next word in a sequence.
Next-word prediction is sensible because it harnesses the inherent sequential nature
of language to train models on understanding context, structure, and relationships
within text. LLMs utilize an architecture called the transformer, which allows them to pay selective attention to different parts of the input when making predictions, making them
especially adept at handling the nuances and complexities of human language.

Since LLMs are capable of generating text, LLMs are also often referred to as a form
of generative artificial intelligence, often abbreviated as generative AI or GenAI. As illus-
trated in figure 1.1, AI encompasses the broader field of creating machines that can
perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence, including understanding lan-
guage, recognizing patterns, and making decisions, and includes subfields like machine
learning and deep learning.

The spam classification example, in traditional machine learning,
human experts might manually extract features from email text such as the fre-
quency of certain trigger words (for example, “prize,” “win,” “free”), the number of
exclamation marks, use of all uppercase words, or the presence of suspicious links.
This dataset, created based on these expert-defined features, would then be used to
train the model. In contrast to traditional machine learning, deep learning does not
require manual feature extraction. This means that human experts do not need to
identify and select the most relevant features for a deep learning model. (However,
both traditional machine learning and deep learning for spam classification still
require the collection of labels, such as spam or non-spam, which need to be gath-
ered either by an expert or users.)


## Applications of LLMs

Owing to their advanced capabilities to parse and understand unstructured text data,
LLMs have a broad range of applications across various domains. Today, LLMs are
employed for machine translation, generation of novel texts (see figure 1.2), senti-
ment analysis, text summarization, and many other tasks. LLMs have recently been
used for content creation, such as writing fiction, articles, and even computer code.
Moreover, LLMs may be used for effective knowledge retrieval from vast volumes
of text in specialized areas such as medicine or law. This includes sifting through doc-
uments, summarizing lengthy passages, and answering technical questions.
In short, LLMs are invaluable for automating almost any task that involves parsing
and generating text. Their applications are virtually endless, and as we continue to
innovate and explore new ways to use these models, it’s clear that LLMs have the
potential to redefine our relationship with technology, making it more conversational,
intuitive, and accessible.

## Stages of building and using LLMs
Why should we build our own LLMs? Coding an LLM from the ground up is an excel-
lent exercise to understand its mechanics and limitations. Also, it equips us with the
required knowledge for pretraining or fine-tuning existing open source LLM architec-
tures to our own domain-specific datasets or tasks.Using custom-built LLMs offers several advantages, particularly regarding data pri-
vacy. For instance, companies may prefer not to share sensitive data with third-party
LLM providers like OpenAI due to confidentiality concerns. Additionally, developing
smaller custom LLMs enables deployment directly on customer devices, such as laptops
and smartphones, which is something companies like Apple are currently exploring. 
This local implementation can significantly decrease latency and reduce server-related
costs. Furthermore, custom LLMs grant developers complete autonomy, allowing
them to control updates and modifications to the model as needed.

The general process of creating an LLM includes pretraining and fine-tuning. The
“pre” in “pretraining” refers to the initial phase where a model like an LLM is trained
on a large, diverse dataset to develop a broad understanding of language. This pre-
trained model then serves as a foundational resource that can be further refined
through fine-tuning, a process where the model is specifically trained on a narrower
dataset that is more specific to particular tasks or domains. This two-stage training
approach consisting of pretraining and fine-tuning is depicted in figure below.
