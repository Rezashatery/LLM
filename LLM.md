## What is an LLM?
An LLM is a neural network designed to understand, generate, and respond to human-
like text. These models are deep neural networks trained on massive amounts of text
data, sometimes encompassing large portions of the entire publicly available text on
the internet.
The “large” in “large language model” refers to both the model’s size in terms of
parameters and the immense dataset on which it’s trained. Models like this often have
tens or even hundreds of billions of parameters, which are the adjustable weights in
the network that are optimized during training to predict the next word in a sequence.
Next-word prediction is sensible because it harnesses the inherent sequential nature
of language to train models on understanding context, structure, and relationships
within text. LLMs utilize an architecture called the transformer, which allows them to pay selective attention to different parts of the input when making predictions, making them
especially adept at handling the nuances and complexities of human language.
